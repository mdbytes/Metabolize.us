#PrimalStrength

PrimalStrength adapts our ReactSiteTemplate to use the WordPress REST API for post data from a WordPress CMS back end. Features of the application include:

1.  Upon initiation, the application downloads all of the posts from the blog as an array of objects.

2.  Users can choose to view one of four pages.

3.  An "About" page offers users background on the content originators and what they do.

4.  A "Articles" page presents a summary for all of the posts, including post excerpts and feature photos.

5.  A "Privacy" page offers users the ability to understand security issues such as cookies utilized, non-personal information gathered, etc.

6.  The "Contact Us" page offers a framework for users to contact the content creators. At the present time, the submit button offers a modal which directs users to contact the admin at mdbytes.com

7.  This application offers WordPress content creators the ability to step away from preset theme frameworks. Future work will focus on expanding functionality for content creators to a) directly create post content online, b) edit or modify content directly, and c) manage users online.

This application is currently deployed at [Vercel](https://primal-strength.vercel.app/)
