              Martin's desire for athletic performance can be traced to his
              earliest years, and throughout his life strength training, running
              and cycling, basketball and baseball have played important roles
              each and every year. In high school, Martin played baseball and
              basketball at the AAU level, and lettered in both sports. He
              received all conference honors in basketball as a Senior in a very
              competitive conference. Several of Martin's friends and teammates
              from these years went on to collegiate athletics and even
              professional sports.

            <p>
              After high school, Martin would find his way to NCAA Division III
              Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois, where he participated in
              the basketball and baseball programs. He credits the diet and
              nutrition program at Millikin as his first experience with serious
              growth in strength and muscle mass. He arrived on campus a very
              lean 6'5" and 185 pounds. His coaches prescribed a diet high in
              protein and healthy fats, along with lots of bench presses,
              squats, and deadlifts. Just a year later he was listed in the
              program at strong and athletic 6'5", 215 pounds. This season of
              strength training gave birth to a life long passion.

              Martin's competitive spirit served him well in corporate America.
              After finishing his B.S. in Business at Millikin, Martin completed
              a M.S. at Illinois State University and would take his competitive
              spirit to corporate America. Over 20 years he would work
              exclusively with Fortune 100 companies in leadership positions
              with ever growing areas of responsibility. At his highest level,
              Senior Vice President of a super regional bank, he managed over
              150 employees and 20 branches.

              Staying fit through life can be a challenge, especially in the
              face of illness and injury. After recovering from serious illness
              in 2009, Martin's dedication to fitness would grow tremendously as
              he faced the challenge with his health. Today, after recovering
              fully, Martin devotes his days to encouraging and guiding others
              in their wellness journeys. His approach to fitness is committed
              to building core strength with progressive resistance weight
              training, balanced with an appropriate level of cardio for
              individual needs.
