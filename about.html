        <strong>Youth Sports and Fitness</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Martin&apos;s desire for athletic performance can be traced to his
        earliest years, and throughout his life strength training, running
        and cycling, basketball and baseball have played important roles
        each and every year. In high school, Martin played baseball and
        basketball at the AAU level, and lettered in both sports. He
        received all conference honors in basketball as a Senior in a very
        competitive conference. Several of Martin&apos;s friends and
        teammates from these years went on to collegiate athletics and
        even professional sports.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <strong>Collegiate Strength Training</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        After high school, Martin would find his way to NCAA Division III
        Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois, where he participated in
        the basketball and baseball programs. He credits the diet and
        nutrition program at Millikin as his first experience with serious
        growth in strength and muscle mass. He arrived on campus a very
        lean 6&apos;5&rquo; and 185 pounds. His coaches prescribed a diet
        high in protein and healthy fats, along with lots of bench
        presses, squats, and deadlifts. Just a year later he was listed in
        the program at strong and athletic 6&apos;5&rsquo;, 215 pounds.
        This season of strength training gave birth to a life long
        passion.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <strong>Successful in Business</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Martin&apos;s competitive spirit served him well in corporate
        America. After finishing his B.S. in Business at Millikin, Martin
        completed a M.S. at Illinois State University and would take his
        competitive spirit to corporate America. Over 20 years he would
        work exclusively with Fortune 100 companies in leadership
        positions with ever growing areas of responsibility. At his
        highest level, Senior Vice President of a super regional bank, he
        managed over 150 employees and 20 branches.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <strong>Coaching Youth Sports</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        During his time in corporate life, Martin was active coaching and
        leading youth sports and programs. He has volunteered in various
        capacities for programs at the YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, and the
        Salvation Army.

        Staying fit through life can be a challenge, especially in the
        face of illness and injury. After recovering from serious illness
        in 2009, Martin&apos;s dedication to fitness would grow
        tremendously as he faced the challenge with his health. Today,
        after recovering fully, Martin devotes his days to encouraging and
        guiding others in their wellness journeys. His approach to fitness
        is committed to building core strength with progressive resistance
        weight training, balanced with an appropriate level of cardio for
        individual needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to his training, Martin also attends to the needs of
        <a href="https://mdbytes.com">MD Web Technologies</a>, his web
        development company.
