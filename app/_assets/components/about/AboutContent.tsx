                        Thanks for visiting this page. I created it to share my
                        journey and to share what I have learned and to
                        encourage others. I am 61 years old. My battle with
                        obesity, high blood pressure and prediabetes crept
                        slowly into my adult life. Today, these symptoms
                        combined reflect metabolic syndrome. Winning this battle
                        meant finding a solution and learning some lessons.

                        As a child, I had no idea what <i>obesity</i> or{' '}
                        <i>metabolic syndrome</i> meant. I gained weight easily
                        and carried it well on a large muscular frame. My
                        constitution kept me active as an athlete. I knew myself
                        as a big strong man who came from a family of big strong
                        men. That was it. No one was obese. No one discussed
                        personal family health matters. I had no idea that type
                        2 diabetes had been a big part of family history. I was
                        obese and comfortably in the dark about the real
                        challenges it presented.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My waistline grew steadily. It was well over 40 inches
                        within a few years of playing college athletics. By age
                        32, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. My doctor
                        at the time did me no favors. Neither my weight nor my
                        BMI were mentioned in the meeting where I was first
                        prescribed high blood pressure medication. You see, my
                        doctor was also a big strong man. We were both obese,
                        but neither of us referred to it as such even though it
                        was silently killing us both. That doctor died a few
                        years back. He was only 62 years old.
                        <br />
                        <br /> I got a new doctor in 2010. Since that time,
                        she&apos;s given excellent care. Perhaps the best wisdom
                        she shared was written in her notes on my file:
                        &quot;Martin struggles with obesity.&quot; Serious
                        illnesses accumulated. By the time I was 50, blood tests
                        detected early signs of type 2 diabetes. A short time
                        later a rare lung disease. A few years more and cancer
                        was added to the list.{' '}

                    <p>
                        I knew gaining weight was unhealthy, and always battled
                        to overcome. I tried every diet that came along. If the
                        author of the program wrote a book, I read it. In total,
                        I&apos;ve read hundreds of diet books and tried every
                        single solution. The efforts were not without occasional
                        victories:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lost 70 pounds on Slim Fast</li>
                        <li>Lost 50 pounds on the Zone Diet</li>
                        <li>Lost 40 pounds on the Pritikin Diet</li>
                        <li>Lost 30 pounds on the South Beach Diet</li>
                        <li>Lost 20 pounds at Nutri-System</li>
                        <li>Lost 15 pounds at Weight Watchers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Just on these six programs, I lost 225 pounds. That
                        would be great. But obesity raised it&apos;s ugly head
                        every time. I would gain the weight all back, usually
                        plus 10%. Yes. I lost 225 pounds but then gained 250
                        pounds. The hold was just getting deeper
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My first reaction was to get busy again, returning to
                        the strength and conditioning of my youth. To help me
                        engage and share with others, I completed{' '}

                        as a Certified Fitness Trainer (CFT) and Strength and
                        Conditioning Coach( SSC). It felt great to be strong and
                        to encourage others in strength training. I even
                        competed in power lifting events. But the focus on
                        strength training was masking the continuing issue, i.e.
                        it was still so easy to gain weight and near impossible
                        to control at healthy levels.

                        <strong>Nutrition solution found ... </strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I first explored intermittent fasting and ketogenic
                        nutrition in 2015. By 2018, my BMI was normal, signs of
                        type 2 diabetes had disappeared, blood pressure
                        medication had been reduced to the lowest available
                        dose. It was miraculous. But the past seven years were
                        neither easy nor perfect. Weight was inevitably gained
                        as my commitment to keto waned. The weight would be lost
                        when I returned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most recently, a softball-size tumor in my abdomen
                        contributed to weight gain for almost two years before
                        it was discovered and removed. The cancer was removed
                        and I was back to my nutrition program. The weight was
                        lost and I am otherwise healthy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My greatest nutritional takeaways are threefold. First,
                        some of us gain weight easily. It&apos;s not because we
                        want to be fat, but its a metabolic disorder which could
                        be rooted either things we&apos;ve done in the past or
                        family genetics. Second, for those of us being drug to
                        obesity by our metabolism, it is vital to reject the
                        enemy, engage the battle and commit to victory. Finally,
                        we need a new and smarter solution than what&apos;s
                        being sold in most doctors and weight loss programs.
