                        Thanks for visiting this page. I created it to share my
                        journey and to encourage others in their battle with
                        metabolic syndrome. I am 61 years old. My battle with
                        metabolic syndrome has been ongoing for most of my life
                        but with nutrition and exercise I have found victory.

                    <p>
                        In my early years, athletics kept me busy enough to
                        control my waist size and maintain a concept of strength
                        and fitness. I was typical for most young people -
                        ignorant of my own immortality. But as life progressed,
                        I was constantly battling the bulge around my waist. To
                        put it simple, I got fat very easily. If a person could
                        win awards for gaining weight in a short amount of time,
                        I would need a warehouse for all the trophies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The awards I received for years of losing battles with
                        metabolic syndrome were eye-opening, including
                        prediabetes, lung disease and cancer. It was time to get
                        my act together, if at all possible. I have a lots to
                        live for, but life itself was escaping me quickly thanks
                        to metabolic syndrome.

                    <p>
                        My first reaction was to get busy again, returning to
                        the strength and conditioning of my youth. To help me
                        engage and share with others, I completed{' '}

                        Conditioning Coach( SSC). It felt to be strong again and
                        to encourage others. But something was missing, it was
                        still so easy to gain weight.

                    <p>
                        Through a diet and exercise program that worked for me I
                        was able to say goodbye to obesity worries and embrace a
                        new lifestyle. This works for me, and I am excited about
                        it, which is why I share it on this site.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Victory must be a lifestyle </strong>

                    <p>
                        Staying fit through life can be a challenge. Even on top
                        of the metabolic challenges of gaining weight easily,
                        real life brings with it career, family, friends and
                        community. All of these can be both a blessing and a
                        burden.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to create sustainable victory, it became
                        necessary for me to first accept this new diet and
                        exercise program as more than either a diet or exercise
                        program. They needed to become my lifestyle, an integral
                        part of me. That was the easy part.

                        Sometimes it is necessary to explain my lifestyle
                        restrictions and requirements to others. In the best
                        cases, it goes very well. My family has embraced my
                        needs with love beyond my imagination. But the response
                        is truthfully mixed. Some will tell you keto is a fad
                        diet - despite the fact that research on keto diets
                        existed long before low-fat diets were invented. In any
                        event, be unwavering and the resistance will pass.

                        Your health and physical vitality does not need to be
                        expensive or time consuming. Today, I prefer home gym
                        solutions with cardio and weightlifting that can be
                        pursued for little or no investment. Exercise is
                        recommended as 30 minute workouts, five days a week.
                        Weekends off. My own ketogenic nutrition is accomplished
                        mostly with whole foods readily available at any market.
