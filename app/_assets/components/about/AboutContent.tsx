                        Thanks for visiting metabolize.us. My name is Martin
                        Dwyer and I am over 60 years old. I am cancer free, no
                        longer have high blood pressure, and any signs of
                        prediabetes or lung disease are gone. My health issues
                        were related to metabolism, revealed first in obesity,
                        which translated into obesity, prediabetes, a weakened
                        immune system and cancer. The solutions which I have
                        found are neither unique nor novel. Nor are they
                        commonly recommended in medical offices today. I hope
                        that sharing them here can help encourage others to find
                        victory over chronic disease.

                        As a child, I had no idea what <i>obesity</i> or{' '}
                        <i>metabolic syndrome</i> meant. I gained weight easily
                        and carried it well on a large muscular frame. My
                        constitution kept me active as an athlete. I knew myself
                        as a big strong man who came from a family of big strong
                        men. That was it. No one was obese. No one discussed
                        personal family health matters. I had no idea that type
                        2 diabetes had been a big part of family history. I was
                        obese and comfortably in the dark about the real
                        challenges it presented.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My waistline grew steadily. It was well over 40 inches
                        within a few years of playing college athletics. By age
                        32, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. My doctor
                        at the time did me no favors. Neither my weight nor my
                        BMI were mentioned in the meeting where I was first
                        prescribed high blood pressure medication. You see, my
                        doctor was also a big strong man. We were both obese,
                        but neither of us referred to it as such even though it
                        was silently killing us both. That doctor died a few
                        years back. He was only 62 years old.

                            <strong>The struggle to survive ...</strong>
                        </h4>
                        I got a new doctor in 2010. Since that time, she&apos;s
                        given excellent care. Perhaps the best wisdom she shared
                        was written in her notes on my file: &quot;Martin
                        struggles with obesity.&quot; Serious illnesses were
                        accumulating quickly. Blood tests detected early signs
                        of type 2 diabetes. My first cancer a short time later.
                        I was not just a <i>big strong man</i>, I was{' '}
                        <i>obese and dying from it</i>.
                        <br />
                        <br />I knew gaining weight was unhealthy, and always
                        battled to overcome. I tried every diet that came along.
                        If the author of the program wrote a book, I read it. In
                        total, I&apos;ve read hundreds of diet books and tried
                        every single solution. The efforts were not without
                        occasional victories:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lost 70 pounds on Slim Fast</li>
                        <li>Lost 50 pounds on the Zone Diet</li>
                        <li>Lost 40 pounds on the Pritikin Diet</li>
                        <li>Lost 30 pounds on the South Beach Diet</li>
                        <li>Lost 20 pounds at Nutri-System</li>
                        <li>Lost 15 pounds at Weight Watchers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Just on these six programs, I lost 225 pounds. That
                        would be great. But obesity raised it&apos;s ugly head
                        every time. I would gain the weight all back, usually
                        plus 10%. Yes. I lost 225 pounds but then gained 250
                        pounds. The hold was just getting deeper
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first component of my solution was to return to the
                        weight room and cardio equipment. It was helpful for me
                        to be involved with others, so I competed in power
                        lifting events and did whatever it took to maintain a
                        healthy weight class. However, the{' '}
                        <i>whatever it takes</i> part of that formula was for me
                        starvation. Usually extended periods with less than
                        1,200 calories per day. This was unsustainable. I was
                        different. I needed a different solution for my
                        metabolism.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I first explored intermittent fasting and ketogenic
                        nutrition in 2015. By 2018, my BMI was normal, signs of
                        type 2 diabetes had disappeared, blood pressure
                        medication had been reduced to the lowest available
                        dose. It was miraculous. But the past seven years were
                        neither easy nor perfect. Weight was inevitably gained
                        as my commitment to keto waned. The weight would be lost
                        when I returned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most recently, a softball-size tumor in my abdomen
                        contributed to weight gain for almost two years before
                        it was discovered and removed. The cancer was removed
                        and I was back to my nutrition program. The weight was
                        lost and I am otherwise healthy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My greatest nutritional takeaways are threefold. First,
                        some of us gain weight easily. It&apos;s not because we
                        want to be fat, but its a metabolic disorder which could
                        be rooted either things we&apos;ve done in the past or
                        family genetics. Second, for those of us being drug to
                        obesity by our metabolism, it is vital to reject the
                        enemy, engage the battle and commit to victory. Finally,
                        we need a new and smarter solution than what&apos;s
                        being sold in most doctors and weight loss programs.
