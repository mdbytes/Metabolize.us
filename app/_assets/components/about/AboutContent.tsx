                        Thanks for visiting this page. I created it to share my
                        journey and to encourage others in their battle with
                        metabolic syndrome. I am 61 years old. My battle with
                        metabolic syndrome (obesity, high blood pressure,
                        prediabetes) has been ongoing most of my life. I hope my
                        experience, research and success can be a positive
                        influence in your life.

                        <strong>Obesity Creeps In...</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        As a child, I had no idea what <i>obesity</i> or{' '}
                        <i>metabolic syndrome</i> meant. I gained weight easily
                        and carried it well on my large frame. My constitution
                        kept me active as an athlete. I knew myself as a big
                        strong man who came from a family of big strong men.
                        That was it. No one was obese. No one had metabolic
                        syndrome. Well, at least that's what I thought. It is
                        what we all thought.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an adult, my waistline grew steadily. It had been
                        over 40 inches for several years when I was first
                        diagnosed with high blood pressure. My doctor at the
                        time did me no favors. Neither my weight nor my BMI were
                        mentioned in the meeting where I was first prescribed
                        high blood pressure medication. You see, my doctor was
                        also a big strong man. We were both obese, but neither
                        of us understood how much it was affecting my health.

                        <strong>Then Disease ...</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        As obesity persisted through adulthood, serious
                        illnesses accumulated. By the time I was 50, I had lung
                        disease and high blood pressure. A few years later you
                        can add cancer to the list. Then I started reading my
                        doctors notes from my visits. On one occasion, I her
                        words gave me a new and illuminating perspective;
                        "Martin struggles with obesity".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How odd, I thought, that the doctor would write that I
                        struggled with obesity. But remember that I, like most
                        people in my circumstance, grow up around{' '}
                        <i>big people</i> who were never referred to as obese.
                        But I have struggled with obesity - never giving up.
                        Battles and victories included:

                        <li>

                        <li>
                            Endless fad diets including South Beach Diet,
                            Pritikin Diet, the Grapefruit Diet and many more

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Obesity would eventually win. I would gain the weight
                        all back, usually plus 10%. I was ill and desperate to
                        beat this.

                        It took some time, but I have come to understand what it
                        means for someone to{' '}

                        . Unfortunately, my answers to this question were not
                        found in the medical community at large.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My first reaction was to get busy again, returning to
                        the strength and conditioning of my youth. To help me
                        engage and share with others, I completed{' '}

                        as a Certified Fitness Trainer (CFT) and Strength and
                        Conditioning Coach( SSC). It felt to be strong again and
                        to encourage others. But something was missing, it was
                        still so easy to gain weight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through a diet and exercise program that worked for me I
                        was able to say goodbye to obesity worries and embrace a
                        new lifestyle. This works for me, and I am excited about
                        it, which is why I share it on this site.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Victory must be a lifestyle </strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Staying fit through life can be a challenge. Even on top
                        of the metabolic challenges of gaining weight easily,
                        real life brings with it career, family, friends and
                        community. All of these can be both a blessing and a
                        burden.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to create sustainable victory, it became
                        necessary for me to first accept this new diet and
                        exercise program as more than either a diet or exercise
                        program. They needed to become my lifestyle, an integral
                        part of me. That was the easy part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes it is necessary to explain my lifestyle
                        restrictions and requirements to others. In the best
                        cases, it goes very well. My family has embraced my
                        needs with love beyond my imagination. But the response
                        is truthfully mixed. Some will tell you keto is a fad
                        diet - despite the fact that research on keto diets
                        existed long before low-fat diets were invented. In any
                        event, be unwavering and the resistance will pass.

                        Your health and physical vitality does not need to be
                        expensive or time consuming. Today, I prefer home gym
                        solutions with cardio and weightlifting that can be
                        pursued for little or no investment. Exercise is
                        recommended as 30 minute workouts, five days a week.
                        Weekends off. My own ketogenic nutrition is accomplished
                        mostly with whole foods readily available at any market.
