            PS collects information from its website users in several different

            submission or registration process, where a website user is
            requesting a free trial or a courtesy newsletter, registering for an
            event, or responding to similar offers such as sample reports, white
            papers or more product information. Additionally, we may collect
            information that is sent to PS by your web browser, such as
            &#8220;cookies.&#8221; Finally, PS may collect and aggregate data
            using third party code. However, data collected by these companies
            is used only by PS and is not shared with, nor is it accessible to,
            other companies except as stated herein.
